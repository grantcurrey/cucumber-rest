cucumber-json plugin
======================

This small library adds a common cucumber DSL for writing cucumber tests to test restfull endpoints.  The library
provides the following:

* Step definition library
* Communication library (groovy http builder)
* Grails plugin aimed to work with hauner/grails-cucumber

The key component of this library is a consistent way of writing gherkin syntax specifically around the common actions
associated with setting up, transmitting and interrogating restfull transactions.
